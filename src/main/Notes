vector is scalar and direction

scalar is numeric with a measurement type

measurement type is in Unit measure lib

direction is 3d dim x,y,z or 2 angles- theta and rho  Relative to a frame or body

Frame0 is base frame position x,y,z === 0, radial angle theta of 0 = x axis, polar angle rho of 0 = z axis

Body is an object with physical attributes
    relative position to another frame/body where 0,0,0 is defined as 1.fixed point relative to other frame/body or 2.moving with
     respect to other frame/body - orbits
    relative orientation to another frame/body
    relative linear motion vector to another frame/body
    relative rotation to another frame/body or it's own axis

=== MAYBE>>>
Additional frames are fixed or not fixed
    relative position to another frame/body where 0,0,0 is defined as fixed point from other frame/body or moving with
     respect to other frame/body - orbits or vectors
    relative orientation to another frame/body where theta and rho are defined as fixed angles from other frame/body
     or moving with respect to other frame/body - rotation
